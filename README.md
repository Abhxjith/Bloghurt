# Getting Started with Bloghurt 
[bloghurt.com](https://bloghurt.vercel.app/login)

Welcome to **Bloghurt**, an app where you can write and share your blog posts! Additionally, you can generate AI-powered summaries of your blogs using Gemini AI. This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have your **Gemini API key** and **Firebase configuration keys** ready. These keys are necessary for the AI summary generation and Firebase services integration.

1. **Gemini API Key**: You'll need to generate a Gemini API key and store it in the `.env` file.
2. **Firebase Config Keys**: You will also need your Firebase configuration keys for authentication and database integration.

Make sure to add the following to your `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.
